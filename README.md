# hello-world
A place to put planned future projects before there's anything to them, pretty much a code-free zone.

Also a place to practice my coding skills in general. 
Cannot believe it took me this long to get on GitHub it's... shameful.

I think right now what I'd like to do is work on some web-design related projects.
I feel like those skills are going to be useful working with the Nerd Watch.

I also want to do a bit of database fooling-about, so that I can continue to say I actually know SQL.
